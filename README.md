dinkyDSP
========

Small, simple and extensible real-time audio synthesis framework for Unity4 written in c-sharp

Currently this codebase is in heavy development! Be prepared for major refactors!

Welcome to the alpha release of dinkyDSP - A real-time synthesis library for Unity.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goals of dinkyDSP are to be small, simple, extensible and fun for experimentation.

dinkyDSP is aimed at developers with some DSP experience or at least developers who are DSP curious and don't mind reading around the subject area. In it's current state it doesn't have much abstraction that will 'just do this cool thing' but that doesn't mean that it won't in the future ;)

I intend to use this library primarily for developing my own audio games in Unity but I am sharing it in the spirit of homebrew, which is why it: 

- isn't on the asset store (not a 'snap in')
- is free (please don't *demand* support)
- suits people who like to hack around (feel free to *ask* for support) and contribute o_O

please look at the included demo scene for a code sample and to get started ;)

---!!!warning---

this library (and playing with synthesis in general) can produce some frequencies that may damage your hearing, especially if you have your headphones on and the volume turned up!

be careful - the first few times you run your graphs, have the master volume on your OS TURNED DOWN LOW!
